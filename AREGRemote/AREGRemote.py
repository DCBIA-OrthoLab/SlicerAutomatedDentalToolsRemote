"""
Automated REGistration (AREG) of two timepoints of the same patient, for
cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) and intraoral surface scans (IOS).

Thin GUI over the remote `AREG` tool. The registration runs on the server, so
nothing is installed into Slicer's interpreter, no conda environment is created,
and neither the segmentation models nor the registration checkpoint are ever
downloaded to this machine.

Replaces the former local module, which drove the AREG_CBCT / AREG_IOS /
AREG_IOSCBCT CLIs from inside Slicer and chained them with AMASSS, ASO, ALI and
CrownSeg by hand. `AREG_Method/` is left in the tree but is no longer wired to
this one.

**There is no `.ui` file here, and that is the design rather than an omission.**
The panel is built from the server's schema by `ServerToolsCoreLib.formgen`, so a
field added to the tool server-side appears here with no client release. The
former module's `Resources/UI/AREG.ui` was kept for a while and then deleted,
because keeping it invited edits that changed nothing: CMakeLists did not ship
it and no code read it, so a UI change made there was a silent no-op -- and one
cost a day of looking for it in the wrong place.

    Nothing about the pipeline lives here. Which anatomical regions can be

    fact that a CBCT run is never asked for an intraoral checkpoint, are all in
    the server's schema and rendered by formgen — so a region added server-side

    `AREG_Method` classes whose job was to build the argument dictionaries for
    five different CLIs and run them in sequence. That sequencing is the
    server's now: AREG calls AMASSS, ASO and CrownSeg in-process, so this module
    makes ONE request where the old one launched up to six processes and polled
    a log file for progress.

    In particular the mode is *asked for*, never guessed: a `.zip` can hold CBCT
    volumes or intraoral meshes, so no extension could tell this module which
    pipeline the user wanted. The same goes for `ios_patch`, which picks the
    region the two timepoints are aligned on and, with it, the arch: the palate
    (predicted, upper) or the mucogingival line (built from landmarks, lower).
    The panel shows the checkpoint for one and the landmark folder for the
    other, and that switch is `visible_when` in the schema, not code here.
