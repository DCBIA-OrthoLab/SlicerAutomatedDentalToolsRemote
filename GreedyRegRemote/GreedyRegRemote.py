"""GreedyReg - Greedy affine registration, computed on the tool server.

Replaces the former local module (a Slicer widget driving GreedyReg_CLI, an
ITK-SNAP binary downloaded on first use, and ALI_CBCT run in-process for the
Distant Registration tab). Nothing is computed in Slicer any more: the panel is
generated from the server's `GET /tools` entry, the scans go up, the registered
volumes come back. GreedyReg_Method/ went with it and is no longer in the tree.

Three things about GreedyReg's schema are worth knowing when reading this file:

* **`mode` is what the two upstream tabs became.** Automatic Registration is
  `Greedy`, Distant Registration is `Landmark`, and running one after the other
  - which the old panel told you to do by hand, in a status message - is
  `Landmark + Greedy`. Every argument that belongs to one mode carries a
  `visible_when` on it, so the panel hides what the chosen mode never reads.
  That is the schema's doing; there is no code here for it.
* **The Greedy binary is gone from the client's life.** Upstream downloaded a
  60 MB ITK-SNAP archive (or ran its Windows installer silently) the first time
  you pressed Register, and the "Download Greedy" button existed for when that
  failed. The server's tool depends on the `picsl-greedy` wheel, so there is
  nothing to fetch and no button.
* **Landmark modes cost a second tool.** The server reaches ALI_CBCT through
  its supervisor; the client neither knows nor arranges that. What it means
  here is only that those modes take longer and need a model bundle named.
