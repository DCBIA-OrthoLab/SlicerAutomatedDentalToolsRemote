"""DOCShapeAXI - surface grading, computed on the tool server.

Replaces the former local module (a Slicer widget driving DOCShapeAXI_CLI, a
conda `shapeaxi` environment, a WSL detour on Windows, and a checkpoint
downloaded from a GitHub release on every run). Nothing is computed in Slicer
any more: the panel is generated from the server's `GET /tools` entry, the
surfaces go up, the grades and the GradCAM surfaces come back.
DOCShapeAXI_utils/ went with it and is no longer in the tree.

Two things about DOCShapeAXI's schema are worth knowing when reading this file:

* **`task` narrows itself to the anatomy.** Only the nasopharynx airway has a
  model for each of binary, severity and regression; the mandibular condyle and
  the alveolar cleft have one four-grade model each. That is an `options_when`
  rule in the schema, so the combo box re-populates itself when the anatomy
  changes and there is no code for it here. The old panel offered all three
  and reached the four-class model regardless.
* **The result is two things, and the second is the point.** A prediction
  table, and one copy of each surface carrying a GradCAM array per grade. The
  arrays are what let a clinician see WHERE the model was looking, so the
  surfaces are what this module offers to load into the scene - not the table.
