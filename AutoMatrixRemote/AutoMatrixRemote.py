"""AutoMatrix - apply a registration matrix, computed on the tool server.

Replaces the former local module (a Slicer widget driving Automatrix_CLI, plus
a Mirror check box that downloaded a matrix from a GitHub release and typed its
path into the matrix field). Nothing is computed in Slicer any more: the panel
is generated from the server's `GET /tools` entry, the scans and the matrices
go up, the moved files come back. AutoMatrix_Method/ went with it; the unused
Resources/UI/ is all that is left of the hand-written panel.

Three things about AutoMatrix's schema are worth knowing when reading this file:

* **There is no mode, so nothing is hidden.** Every argument is read on every
  run, which is why no `visible_when` appears anywhere in the schema and why
  there is no conditional code here. The sections separate the two paths a user
  must fill in from the things they only sometimes change.
* **The Mirror button is gone and the mirroring is not.** The server's tool
  still applies a matrix whose name contains "mirror" in the scan's own space,
  as upstream does; what has gone is the client downloading `Mirror.zip` to get
  hold of one. A mirroring matrix is now named like any other file.
* **A landmark file is a result too.** AutoMatrix moves `.mrk.json` control
  points as readily as it resamples a volume, so what comes back is a mixture
  and both kinds are offered to the scene.
