    tool's answer, a run's terminal message, a schema's description. Shown as

    a convincing "click here to re-authenticate". Escaped, it is just text.

    A string with no `<` is returned unchanged: Qt never takes it for HTML, and
    escaping it would print `&amp;` literally. Anything else is escaped and
    wrapped in `<qt>`, which makes Qt render it as (inert) rich text, so the
