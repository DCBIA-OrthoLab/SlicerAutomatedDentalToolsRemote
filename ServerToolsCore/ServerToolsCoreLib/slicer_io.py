    """Turn a loaded scan into a 3D rendering, with `preset` applied.

    Loading a volume puts it in the slice views and nothing more; the 3D view
    stays empty until a volume-rendering display node exists and is switched
    on. For a tool whose whole output IS a scan -- an orientation, a
    registration -- that empty 3D view is what a clinician reads as "it did not
    work".

    **Driven through the module's own widgets, not by writing to the nodes.**
    Writing the curve directly does produce the right image, and that is what
    this did first -- but the preset list and the Shift slider are the module's
    own state, with no counterpart in MRML (`offsetPreset` is a widget slot;
    the logic library holds no offset at all). So the picture was right while
    the panel said "no preset, shift 0", and the next person to touch the
    slider would have started from a curve that was already moved without
    anything saying by how much.

    Setting the two controls instead means Slicer applies both through its own
    code path: the module reads CT-AAA and 580, and the shift cannot drift from
    what that slider would have done.

    Which preset suits a result is the MODULE's to say (see
    `ServerToolWidgetBase.VOLUME_RENDERING`): a dental CBCT and an MRI want
    different curves, and this library has no way to tell them apart.

    Returns the display node, or None when this build has no volume-rendering

    All four, because all four are the module's own state: a rendering can be
    loaded, carry the right curve and still be switched off, which is a 3D view
    that looks broken with nothing to say why.

    The order is not cosmetic and each step was paid for:

    * the VOLUME first -- the module applies a preset to whatever IS selected
      in it, and the Shift slider's range is computed from that volume, so a
      value set earlier is clamped against the wrong scan;
    * the SHIFT after the preset -- applying a preset resets the offset, so a
      shift set first is thrown away without a word;
    * VISIBILITY last -- reaching the module instantiates its widget, which
      reacts to the volume being selected and settles the rendering's state.

    Best effort, and loudly so. If a Slicer release renames one of these
    controls the rendering is still there, with the default curve, and the log
    says which name went missing rather than leaving a scene nobody can explain.
