"""Persists a user-editable override of config.py's defaults via Slicer's
native qt.QSettings (an ini/plist file on disk, independent of the Slicer
process - survives restarts).

Not imported by `__init__.py` on purpose: it depends on `qt`, and the package
must stay importable outside Slicer for client.py's unit tests. Only Slicer-
side code (ServerToolsCore.py at startup, ServerToolsSettingsWidget) uses it.

`config.py` remains the compiled-in defaults; this module is the optional
layer on top, edited via the "Server Tools Settings" module.
