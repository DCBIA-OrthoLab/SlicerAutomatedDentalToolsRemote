"""CNE - clinical note extraction, computed on the tool server.

Replaces the former local module, which pip-installed llama-cpp-python, PyMuPDF
and python-docx into Slicer's interpreter, downloaded a 4.4-4.9 GB GGUF model
from Hugging Face into the user's Documents folder, and drove the CNE_CLIRemote
command-line module. Nothing is installed or downloaded here any more: the
panel is generated from the server's `GET /tools` entry, the notes go up, the
extractions come back. CNE_CLIRemote/, the hand-written Resources/UI/CNE.ui and
the bundled Resources/testfiles/ went with it.

What the old panel offered, and where it went:

* **Notes folder** -> `notes`, which takes one note or a folder of them and
  filters the dialog on the extensions the tool's readers read.
* **TMJ / Ortho radio buttons** -> `notes_type`. It still picks the model: the
  `model` field defaults to "(automatic)", which the tool resolves to the
  bundle fine-tuned for that note type. Naming a model is possible, and a model
  that does not match the note type is reported in the run's warnings.
* **Summary folder** -> the shared output-folder row.
* **Download Test Files** -> the test notes the server hosts for this tool,
  offered in the `notes` row's own dropdown like every other module's.
* **The model download dialog and the pip-install prompt** -> dropped: the
  model lives on the server and so does the inference engine.
* **The CLI progress bar and Cancel button** -> the shared run controls.
