"""
Impacted canine segmentation on CBCT (CLIC).

Thin GUI over the remote `CLIC` tool. The Mask R-CNN inference runs on the
server, so torchvision is never installed into Slicer's interpreter and no
checkpoint is downloaded to this machine.

It replaces a local module that ran that inference here; `runner/` and the
hand-written `Resources/UI/CLIC.ui` went with it. The panel is generated from
the server's `GET /tools` entry.
